Notes from the course.

In our brain.
It seems that a thought spawns and then is picked up by our subconsciousness. It is only though our wisdom, our developed subconsciousness, that we are able to understand the problem by relating the problem to an existing solved pattern. Yet a new thought that doesn't have any recognizable patterns isn't able to be solved. This is thought in focused mode.

However in diffuse mode. It allows you to think in reflective mode, allowing you to create new neural pathways to train your subconsciousness. I have to image that some form of diffuse mode operates in the subconsciousness, given that there is no superconsciousness or anything of the sort. What diffuse mode does is to allow you to hone in on a starting point to identify a solution for focused thought.
