Notes from the course.
----------------------------------------------

Different learning methods
* focused - deep concentration
* diffuse - high-level wide-area thinking. Let your mind wander and make random connections between different things

You can't engage in both ways of thinking at once. Both are needed for study.
Take frequent breaks when studying in front of a computer.

Couple tutorials:
* Learn how to create a video player
* Learn the CSS box model
Couple reference materials:
* What is the syntax of the CSS background property?

Create a goal. Plan that goal. Schedule that goal.
